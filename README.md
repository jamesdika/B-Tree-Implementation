# B-Tree-Implementation
This is my implementation of a B+ tree
B+ trees are a data structure in which records can only be stored at leaf nodes. 
The leaf nodes of a B+ tree are stored together 

B+ trees are a self-balancing tree data strategies Advantages of B+ trees are as follows:

1) Records can be fetched in equal number of disk accesses.
2) Height of the tree is extremely balanced and is less than that of a B tree
3) Faster search queries since records are only stored on the leaf node.
